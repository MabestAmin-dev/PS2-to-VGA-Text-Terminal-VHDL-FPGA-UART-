- **KBD_ENC** ‚Äì Decodes PS/2 keyboard scan codes.
- **PRET_CPU** ‚Äì Pretend CPU logic that interprets scan codes into VRAM write commands.
- **VIDEO_RAM** ‚Äì Dual-port video memory storing display tiles/characters.
- **VGA_MOTOR** ‚Äì Generates VGA timing signals and fetches data from VRAM for display.
- **VGA_lab** ‚Äì Top-level entity connecting all components.
- **VGA_lab_tb** ‚Äì Testbench that simulates PS/2 keyboard inputs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Simulator:** ModelSim, GHDL, Riviera-PRO, or equivalent VHDL simulator
- **FPGA board (optional for hardware test):** With VGA output & PS/2 input
- **VHDL standard:** IEEE VHDL-2008 (works with VHDL-93 if adjusted)
- External components (`KBD_ENC`, `PRET_CPU`, `VGA_MOTOR`) must be provided from the lab/course materials.

## üöÄ How to Simulate

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile all sources
Make sure your simulator knows where `src/` and `tb/` are.

Example with **GHDL**:
```bash
ghdl -a src/VIDEO_RAM.vhd src/VGA_lab.vhd tb/VGA_lab_tb.vhd
